**Story Line -**

A tribal warrior's fierce struggle to save his people a millennium ago is mysteriously linked to a shadow cop's perilous quest in the present.

Kanguva, directed by Siva, is an ambitious cinematic spectacle that aims to redefine the scope of Indian period-action dramas.
Headlined by Suriya, who once again proves his mettle as a versatile actor, Kanguva weaves together elements of mythology, history, and fantasy into a visually rich narrative.
This film, set across different time periods, explores the tale of a warrior cursed with immortality, confronting themes of fate, revenge, and redemption.

From the outset, Kanguva stuns with its immersive cinematography. Siva and the team have painstakingly created vast, textured landscapes that complement the epic scale of the story.
Cinematographer Vetri Palanisamy captures every sequence with a keen eye, whether it’s a serene mountainscape or an intense battle scene.
The VFX and costume design are commendable, blending traditional and fantastical elements seamlessly to reflect the film’s unique time and setting.

User Review -
A movie which lost sight of its intention. No matter how good the cinematography, acting, action, graphics... An overdose of it is definitely not enjoyable. Do these directors watch the movie from the point of view of an audience... We can't sit for 2.5 hours and watch people kill each other in a variety of ways.
I wish they had focused on having a proper story also. This is not a good direction that our movies are heading towards... Violence...aggression.. revenge.. how is that enjoyable.
There's no relief between the violent scenes. Too much screaming, graphic violence. This movie is not a pleasant watch for sure.
